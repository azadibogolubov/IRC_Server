IRC Server
==========

This project was created for my Fall 2014 post-bacclaureate Internetworking Protocols class,
and is my interpretation of an IRC Client and Server. 

Included, you will find the RFC Document highlighting all server commands and details.

To run the code, you will need Java 7 Standard Edition.

If you would like to contribute to the code, please fork and make a pull request with your changes, 
as this is something I would like to see be built upon and improved over time.
